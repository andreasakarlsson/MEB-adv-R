#+OPTIONS: ':t num:nil

#+DESCRIPTION: Study group for R users at MEB
#+KEYWORDS:  R, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology
#+LANGUAGE:  en

* Meetings & presentations
** TODO Reading: *Advanced R* - Debugging, condition handling, and defensive programming :All:Johan:
<2017-06-08 tor 10:30-11:30>
+ Read & do the exercises in the *Exceptions and debugging* chapter before the meeting.

+ The material is available here:
  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html

+ At the helm: Johan
+ Location: Wargentin
** DONE Reading: *Advanced R* - Environments                      :All:Alex:
<2017-04-27 tor 10:30-11:30>
+ Read & do the exercises in the *Environments* chapter before the meeting.

+ The material is available here:
  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html

+ We will draw parallels between the Environments chapter and the
  [[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html#rc][reference classes from the OO chapter]].

+ Suggested solutions to the Environment chapter are available here:
  [[file:advancedR/Renvironments_notes.html][Notes on Environments]]

<2017-03-30 tor 10:30-11:30>
+ Read & do the exercises in the *OO field guide* chapter before the meeting.

+ The material is available here:
  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html

+ Also, Alex will briefly go through something that came up during the
  previous meeting.

+ Location: Wargentin
** DONE Reading: *Advanced R* - vocabulary, style and functions        :All:Andreas:
<2017-02-23 tor 10:30-11:30>
+ Read & do the exercises in the *vocabulary*, *style* and *functions*
  chapters before the meeting.

  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html
  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
  + http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html

+ The major focus will be the functions chapter. The first two
  chapters are short and will only be discussed if there are specific
  questions (the style chapter might be better suited over a friendly
  cup of coffee).

+ Suggested solutions to the functions chapter are available here:

** DONE Meetings  <2016-03-31 Thu>
*** Attendees
Xingrong, Elisabeth, Andreas, Nathalie, Henric, Arvid, Peter, Mark and Alex
*** Decisions
+ The meeting will take place every three weeks.
+ The meeting format will be casual with one person presenting
  (inspired by the applied biostat group).
+ There were also discussions regarding a reading group with particular
  interest in the Advanced R book http://adv-r.had.co.nz/.
** Purpose of the meetings
There is a lot of knowledge and advanced usage of R within MEB. It
would be nice to be able to share some of that knowledge. Preferably
this could be done without creating too much extra work.

The distinction between *functional* OOP, as in S3 and S4, and
Java/C++-style *encapsulated* OOP, as in Reference Classes and
R6. Here’s a link to nice paper by John Chambers
http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ss/1408368569
discussing these issues. For more on this, the paper has now grown
into a book that’ll be published later this year:
