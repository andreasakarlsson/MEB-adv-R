* Purpose
There is a lot of knowledge and advanced usage of R within MEB. It
would be nice to be able to share some of that knowledge. Preferably
this could be done without creating too much extra work.
* Meeting <2016-03-31 Thu>
** Attendees
Xingrong, Elisabeth, Andreas, Nathalie, Henric, Arvid, Peter, Mark and Alex
** Decisions
+ The meeting will take place every three weeks.
+ The meeting format will be casual with one person presenting
  (inspired by the applied biostat group).
+ There were also discussions regarding a reading group with particular
  interest in the Advanced R book http://adv-r.had.co.nz/.
* Planned presentations
** Robust variance                                                   :Arvid:
