* General thoughts on an advanced R study group
There is a lot of knowledge of advanced usage of R within MEB. It
would be nice to be able to share some of that knowledge. Preferably
this could be done without creating too much extra work.
* Discussion topics of the top of my mind
** Making R-packages
  + Documentation :: Roxygen, Rmarkdown
  + Testing :: testthat, assertthat, r-travis
 Data Management
  + dplyr, data.table, sqldf vs base
** General coding schemes
*** R classes and object oriented coding in R
    + http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/s3Classes.html
*** Functional coding in R
    + Functional-package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/functional/functional.pdf

    + Closures

    + Macros

      Programmerâ€™s Niche: Macros in R: https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf
    + Monads and Gonads?
    + Functors?
** Operators
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/operators/operators.pdf
** Extending R
  + Rcpp
  + js-plots :: rChars, ggvis & htmlwidgets
** Speeding up R
  + Multi-core :: parallel, foreach
  + Multi-node :: Rmpi, RHadoop
  + Compiled R code

* Read/discuss books or articles
+ R cookbook
+ http://adv-r.had.co.nz/
+ other?
* Other discussions
+ Introduce R to new users within MEB
+ Host Stockholm R useR (SRUG) group meetup at MEB
+ Reuse some study-group material for SRUG presentation
